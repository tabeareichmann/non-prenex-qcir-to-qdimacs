# non-prenex-qcir-to-qdimacs

Getting started
-

Requires the [TatSu](https://pypi.org/project/TatSu/#description) package installed. TL;DR:
```
pip install TatSu
```

Then, the parsing prototype can be run with
```
python3 ./parsing/parse-instance.py
```

In the *grammars* folder, there is a specification of QCIRC-formulas that are not in prenex form, cleansed, closed and in nnf. The spec is written in [EBNF-style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form) and adapted from the [QCIRC-specification](http://www.qbflib.org/qcir.pdf). Have a look at the [TatSu Docs](https://tatsu.readthedocs.io/en/stable/syntax.html#rules) for more details.

The *FormulaTree* class provides [Semantic Actions](https://tatsu.readthedocs.io/en/stable/semantics.html) for the parser generated by TatSu. Basically, whenever a rule from the spec fires, the method with the same name in the semantic actions class is called. This is used to construct a formula tree structure. As of now, parsing makes the following assumptions:
- Each gate is only defined once
- Each gate is defined before it is used
